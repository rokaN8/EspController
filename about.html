            <h2>Inspiration & Vision</h2>

            <h3>üßó Moonboard Training System</h3>
            <p>This project serves as a proof-of-concept for creating a home bouldering training system inspired by the <strong>Moonboard</strong> - a standardized climbing training board used worldwide. The Moonboard features a grid of climbing holds with LED indicators that light up to show specific boulder problems (routes), allowing climbers to train consistently using the same problems regardless of location.</p>

            <h3>üè† Home Training Vision</h3>
            <p>The goal is to develop an affordable, DIY version of commercial LED climbing systems for home use. By using readily available components like ESP32 microcontrollers and addressable LED strips, climbers can create their own interactive training boards.</p>

            <h3>üìà Scalable Design</h3>
            <p>While this 5√ó6 grid demonstrates the core technology with 30 LEDs, the system can be scaled to match standard training board dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Moonboard:</strong> 11√ó18 grid (198 holds)</li>
                <li><strong>Kilter Board:</strong> 12√ó12 grid (144 holds)</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Walls:</strong> Any configuration for home setups</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The modular approach allows climbers to start with a small prototype and expand their setup over time as they add more holds to their home wall.</p>

            <h3>üöÄ Future Potential</h3>
            <p>This foundation enables advanced features like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Route database integration with difficulty ratings</li>
                <li>Timer and session tracking</li>
                <li>Progressive training programs</li>
                <li>Community route sharing</li>
                <li>Video analysis integration</li>
                <li>Competition mode with standardized problems</li>
            </ul>
